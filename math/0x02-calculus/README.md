### [9. Our life is the sum total of all the decisions we make every day, and those decisions are determined by our priorities](./9-sum_total.py)
Write a function `def summation_i_squared(n):` that calculates\
![](https://i.ibb.co/DYDxtPH/9.png)
* `n` is the stopping condition
* Return the integer value of the sum
* If `n` is not a valid number, return `None`
* You are not allowed to use any loops

### [10. Derive happiness in oneself from a good day's work](./10-matisse.py)
Write a function `def poly_derivative(poly):` that calculates the derivative of a polynomial:

* `poly` is a list of coefficients representing a polynomial
  * the index of the list represents the power of `x` that the coefficient belongs to
  * Example: if `f(x) = x^3 + 3x +5`, `poly` is equal to `[5, 3, 0, 1]`
* If `poly` is not valid, return `None`
* If the derivative is `0`, return `[0]`
* Return a new list of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial

### [16. Double whammy](./16-double)
![Integral](https://i.ibb.co/GTJsvtc/16.png)

### [17. Integrate](./17-integrate.py)
Write a function `def poly_integral(poly, C=0):` that calculates the integral of a polynomial:

* `poly` is a list of coefficients representing a polynomial
  * the index of the list represents the power of `x` that the coefficient belongs to
  * Example: if `f(x) = x^3 + 3x +5`, `poly` is equal to `[5, 3, 0, 1]`
* `C` is an integer representing the integration constant
* If a coefficient is a whole number, it should be represented as an integer
* If `poly` or `C` are not valid, return `None`
* Return a new list of coefficients representing the integral of the polynomial
* The returned list should be as small as possible
